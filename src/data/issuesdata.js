  { id: 1, title: 'On Civil Engagement: ', text: "Civic engagement is probably one of my favorite topics ever. Civic engagement, to me, it's easy. It's people coming together to formulate the best possible result to those that we share the neighborhood, city, county, state, country, and world, with. It can stem from being at every council meeting to attending the plays at the arts center. From planting the city trees, to joining in for a 5K. When people come together and share in their lives experiences, we grow. I truly feel that way." },
  { id: 2, title: 'On Campaign Finance: ', text: "I may be frugal when it comes to the amount of resources i use to put myself out there. Fact, I am more likely to talk to you on the phone than want to put up a plastic sign. I think we need to find a reasonable solution to the cost it takes to represent our communities. We don't live in a reality where we can successfully run a campaign with out extensive costs and donations. I am not sure that the current structure is the best for democracy, I do know, however, that at this time, it is what it is. I think there are a lot of people trying to bring a more level field to bringing this fact down; and want to create a campaign environment that is more suitable to the actual people that are being represented. I think it's fair to continue the conversation, and educate those that may not even be aware of the 'strings attached' when it comes to donors, and campaign financing." },
  { id: 3, title: 'On Taxes: ', text: "I would not ever be able to say that taxes wont get raised. That would be quite irrational. What we can do is focus on how to keep your taxes as stable as possible. In order to do so, we can focus on the areas that will bring in more revenue, perhaps by people visiting from other cities, because of what West Jordan may have to offer. If we can plan our growth in a way that benefits our residence and hopefully excites people from other parts of the county, we can bring in more revenue and keep the taxes that we pay, stable." },
  { id: 4, title: 'On the Arts: ', text: "To fund the arts, responsibly, is to fund culture, imagination, progress, and diversity. It is essential that each community embrace their experiences, and share them with out fear. To do so is to value the arts and ability of all. I will, with 100% conviction dedicate my time as Mayor to assure the humans that live among us have the right, and the safe place to express themselves, the arts, past, present, and future." },
  { id: 5, title: 'On Education: ', text: "I have young children, and one that has already graduated HS.  I know of the struggle with in our public school system. We  must recognize that growth can't out run our classes too quickly.  Because west jordan Faces becoming one of the largest cities in the County in the coming years.  We need to assure the best successes for our children, by providing them easy to access education from Pre K to College.  It's a great thing that we have the community college right in our city.  We must fight to keep it state of the art, and affordable." },
  { id: 6, title: 'On Transportatation: ', text: "It is crucial at this time in our growing community to be eager to build upon our transportation needs.  East to West I understand as a problem we all face.  We need to work together to ensure safety.  I want to sit down with developers and engineers to create the best possible outcome for our east to west problems.  Weather it be flex lanes, or widened through ways.  Our community deserves to be put in the forefront for our traffic needs,  we have waited long enough.  I support the move to beautify redwood, as well as adding the safer crossing walks, and bus pull outs.  Ease in getting to trax, and working with UTA to assure the people of the southern county cities have their needs met to ease in public transit." }
