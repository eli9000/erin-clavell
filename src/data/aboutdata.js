  { id: 6, text: 'I am passionate in engaging with the community, and contribute in positive activism for all people.  Having multiple years of working in local politics, I have always been influenced by the value of participation on the most local of levels. With connection, compassion, and desire, I find that our own neighborhoods are a direct guidance in what we do, and where we go in life.  I would like to see the community of West Jordan thrive on the foundation that is established here, and be open to the potential of the future residents.' },
  { id: 7, text: 'We live a time where the future is now.  In many respects the well-being of our past, present, and future, is the ability and need to keep up with what the market offers, and what the people desire, now.  Growth in our city can keep up with the new trends, while keeping the original hometown feel.  It is with these perspectives that I want efficient ways in which the city can grow and prosper, while maintaining the personality that we already have in West Jordan.' }
